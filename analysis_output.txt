It returns the results of the risk assessment in a *RiskInfoArray* that provides the outcomes for all the models performed as part of the risk assessment.  The requestor can define the list of models that will be performed in the risk assessment. If the models are not defined then a default set of models will be performed, and results returned. As FPAD adapts to changing transactional behaviour, the returned risk assessment may change for different invocations of the API for the same account.
